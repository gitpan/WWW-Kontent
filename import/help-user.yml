In any case, creating and using a user account is always recommended, as it allows your edits to be attributed to you.\n\n= Creating a user account\n\nTo create an account, navigate to the [[Users]] section of the site and click the &``create&'' tab.  You will need to provide a username and password, and possibly other information depending on the site.\n\n= Logging in\n\nYou will be logged out each time you close your browser.  To log back in, click the &``change user&'' link near the top of your page.  Enter your username, then your password when prompted for it, and you'll be logged in."
