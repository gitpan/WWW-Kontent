You can also review this page's revision history by clicking &``History&''.  The &``Export&'' link uses XML to give you insight into what's going on behind the scenes.  No doubt you will want to customize your Kontent instance; to do so, navigate to [[kontent/settings||]] and continue from there.\n\nFormatting is performed with a simple markup language called Kolophon.  For information on how to use Kolophon, see [[help/kolophon||its help page]].\n\nIn this early version of Kontent, it is not yet possible to log in and associate your edits with a particular user; that feature will come soon.  Security is also missing thus far.  However, you can get a sense for Kontent's capabilities, and hopefully you'll be excited by its potential.\n\nPlease note that all pages included in the Kontent distribution are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license.
