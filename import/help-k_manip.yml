    kiki:content: " ``k_manip`` is a powerful command-line tool for examining, modifying and creating pages.  It can be used to edit pages in ways not possible through Kontent's web interface, by directly controlling the attributes of new revisions.\n\nAlthough extremely useful, ``k_manip`` does its job with only a few commands:\n\n; ``k_manip list`` //path//\n: Lists the given page's children.\n; ``k_manip show`` //path//\n: Displays all the attributes of the given revision along with their values.\n; ``k_manip revise`` //path// //attr1=value1// //attr2=value2//...\n: Creates a new revision, setting the given attributes to the given values.\n; ``k_manip create`` //path// //pagename// //attr1=value1// //attr2=value2//...\n: Creates a new page with the name //pagename// under the page indicated by //path//, with the specified attributes and values.\n; ``k_manip skeleton`` //path//\n: Runs the page's driver and adapter, then dumps the skeleton generated by the adapter."
