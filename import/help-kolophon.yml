    kiki:content: "Kolophon is a simple markup language used to apply formatting to pages.  It \nconsists of only a few commands, but those few can handle the most common types \nof formatting users need.\n\nMost characters in a Kolophon document are treated as simple characters and \ncopied exactly as they are.  However, certain pairs of characters are treated \nas //tags// specifying formatting.  Additionally, some characters at the \nbeginning of a line have special meaning.\n\n= Text formatting\n\n== Basic formatting\n\n! To format...\n! Use the code...\n! Which looks like...\n-\n| Bold text\n| ``**some text**``\n| **some text**\n-\n| Italic text\n| ``//some text//``\n| //some text//\n-\n| A title or citation\n| ``__some text__``\n| __some text__\n-\n| Strike-through\n| ``==some text==``\n| ==some text==\n-\n| Superscript\n| ``^^some text^^``\n| ^^some text^^\n-\n| Subscript\n| ``,,some text,,``\n| ,,some text,,\n\n== Literal formatting\n\n! To make...\n! Use the code...\n! Which looks like...\n-\n| A block of code\n| \"\"``some code``\"\"\n| ``some code``\n-\n| A block of plain text\n| ``\"\"some **unformatted** text\"\"``\n| \"\"some **unformatted** text\"\"\n-\n| A formatting code not be special\n| ``two *\\\\* asterisks``\n| two *\\\\* asterisks\n\n== Links\n\n! To make...\n! Use the code...\n! Which looks like...\n-\n| A link to another site\n| ``[[http://www.google.com]]``\n| [[http://www.google.com]]\n-\n| A link with different text\n| ``[[http://www.google.com||Google]]``\n| [[http://www.google.com||Google]]\n-\n| A link to a local page\n| ``[[Help]]``\n| [[Help]]\n-\n| A link to another section of the site\n| ``[[users/Kontent contributors]]``\n| [[users/Kontent contributors]]\n-\n| An unambiguous link\n| ``[[/users/Kontent contributors]]``\n| [[/users/Kontent contributors]]\n\nA few notes on local links:\n* Although the last portion of a link's address can be a page title or a name, \n  the earlier portions must use the page's name.  (To figure out what a page \n  is named, look in your browser's location or address bar.)\n* Links that start with a / will always be taken to be complete paths.  Links \n  that don't can be under the current page //or any page above it//.\n* If the ``||`` syntax is used but the title portion is left empty, it will be \n  automatically filled in with the page's title.  This is handy if you're \n  linking to a long, complex path like ``[[/kontent/settings/uri_prefix||]]``.\n\n== Special links\n\n! To make...\n! Use the code...\n! Which will...\n-\n| Transclusion link\n| ``{{/kontent/settings/site_name}}``\n| Place that page's contents directly in this page\n-\n| Relation link\n| ``<</category/Help pages>>``\n| Put links on both pages\n\n**Note**: Relation is not implemented yet.\n\n= Line formatting\n\nIn addition to the text formatting mentioned earlier, Kolophon also has several \nline formats, which apply to all following lines until the next line format or \na blank line.  For example:\n\n` == Common phrases\n` \n` * She sells seashells by the sea shore.\n` * The quick brown fox jumped over the \n` lazy dog.\n` \n` Of course, there are many other phrases \n` like these.\n\nWould look something like this:\n\n== Common phrases\n\n* She sells seashells by the sea shore.\n* The quick brown fox jumped over the \nlazy dog.\n\nOf course, there are many other phrases \nlike these.\n\n== Headings\n\nHeadings are indicated with 1&-4 equals signs on the left margin, followed by \na space:\n\n` = First-level heading\n` == Second-level heading\n` === Third-level heading\n` ==== Fourth-level heading\n\n== Lists\n\nBullet lists have an asterisk at the beginning of each list item:\n\n` * Item one\n` * Item two\n` * Item three\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2\n* Item 3\n\nNumber lists have a pound (number) sign instead:\n\n` # Item one\n` # item two\n` # Item three\n\n# Item 1\n# Item 2\n# Item 3\n\nDefinition lists have alternating terms (indicated by colons) and definitions \n(indicated by semicolons):\n\n` ; Term 1\n` : Definition 1\n` ; Term 2\n` : Definition 2a\n` : Definition 2b\n\n; Term 1\n: Definition 1\n; Term 2\n: Definition 2a\n: Definition 2b\n\n== Tables\n\nNormal cells have a vertical bar (``|``) at the beginning of each line; header \ncells have an exclamation point (``!``).  A dash will create a new row.\n\n` ! Hacker\n` ! Language\n` -\n` | Larry Wall\n` | Perl\n` -\n` | Guido van Rossum\n` | Python\n` -\n` | Yukihiro Matsumoto\n` | Ruby\n\n! Hacker\n! Language\n-\n| Larry Wall\n| Perl\n-\n| Guido van Rossum\n| Python\n-\n| Yukihiro Matsumoto\n| Ruby\n\n== Miscellaneous\n\nCode blocks are indicated with a single backtick:\n\n` `$revision.adapter($request);\n\n` $revision.adapter($request);\n\nQuote blocks are indicated with a greater-than sign:\n\n` > I love you, always.  Time is nothing.\n\n> I love you, always.  Time is nothing.\n\n= Special characters\n\nSometimes it can be difficult or impossible to type a character.  Perhaps it's \none which Kontent treats specially, such as backslash, space or return, or \nperhaps it's simply not present on many keyboards.  Kolophon provides special \ncharacters to help you in these situations.\n\nEach special character sequence starts with an ampersand (``&``) and is \nfollowed by one or more punctuation characters.  The special sequences \nrecognized by Kontent include:\n\n! Character\n! Sequence\n! Example\n-\n| Backslash\n| ``&|``\n| &|\n-\n| Space\n| ``&_``\n| foo&_bar\n-\n| Newline\n| ``&^``\n| foo&^bar\n-\n| Em-dash\n| ``&--``\n| &--\n-\n| En-dash\n| ``&-``\n| &-\n-\n| Left arrow\n| ``&<-``\n| &<-\n-\n| Right arrow\n| ``&->``\n| &->\n-\n| Curly single quotes\n| \"\"&`\"\" and \"\"&'\"\"\n| &`Hello world!&'\n-\n| Curly double quotes\n| \"\"&``\"\" and \"\"&''\"\" (or ``&\"``)\n| &``Hello world!&\"\n-\n| Double angle quotes\n| ``&<<`` and ``&>>``\n| &<<Hello world!&>>\n"
